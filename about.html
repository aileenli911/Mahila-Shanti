                  reflect on the life of the village by meeting in committee every week. This has had and still has
                  extraordinary results. The villagers, who never used to consult each other but lived at a distance
                  from each other in different tribes and castes, now sit together, eat together and lead their village
                  in a phenomenal progress of vegetable cultivation, but also of peace and good understanding. They have
                  also learned to take care of the poorest, the widows, the tuberculosis patients. </p>

                  has been living there for more than 70 years now.</p>
                <p class="card-text">That was an amazing opportunity to meet local people and experience a completely
                  different and so
                  beautiful culture through his work. He told me about this inspiring project that didn’t get funding
                  and I thought that we could help make it happen.</p>

                  culture, in our

                  to participate in the realisation of this project. This way, I could combine my knowledge in the

                  great-uncle (director of the NGO receiving donations) who gives his life for over 70 years now in the
                  Indian countryside. His mission is so beautiful: education, empowerment, organization of the natives
                  to reach a maximum autonomy (concretely to resist the invading capitalism, as we know it happens like
                  everywhere else). This mission also involves support regarding people's health, have a look at the
